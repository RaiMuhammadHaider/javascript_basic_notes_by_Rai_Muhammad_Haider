 for creating a class the class keyword is use after the keyword write the class name and then write different method which are basically functions without function keyword in this way different function or mehtods are created and 


 for calling any method or function we will firstly convert the class into Object by new keyword and wrap it into a veriable 

after then it will behave like the object and we can find out the value of it or find out the method inti
